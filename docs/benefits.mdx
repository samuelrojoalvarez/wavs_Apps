>WAVS is a platform that makes building AVSs easier.

**The problem**: creating an AVS the traditional way is complicated. It requires a lot of preliminary development work, such as building custom contracts, scaffolding infrastructure, working with Dockerized components, and coordinating with operators. Most of the development centers around creating AVS infrastructure, which is generally more complicated than the core logic of the service itself.

**There is an easier way**: WAVS provides a base layer of AVS infrastructure so you can focus solely on creating the core logic of your service. This logic is written in Rust (with other languages available soon) and compiled as a lightweight WASI component which can be deployed to the WAVS platform and run as an AVS by operators. These components are run off-chain by operators in the WAVS (WASI-AVS) runtime at near-native speed, and the results are brought verifiably on-chain. A service of services, WAVS allows an AVS to dynamically run and manage multiple components that work together to build flexible and intelligent applications.

## Why WAVS?

WAVS redefines the AVS paradigm, making AVSs easier to build, less expensive to run, and enabling the next generation of composable, intelligent blockchain protocols.

1. Dynamic and Cost-Effective Service Management
    - Flexibility: Add, update, or manage components dynamically without having to coordinate upgrades with an entire operator set.
    - Cost-effective and performant: Multiple AVSs run on the WAVS runtime
        - WASI service components are lightweight compared to Docker, saving storage and startup time.
        - WASI components have instantaneous initialization vs. Docker's redundant OS layers and slower boot times.
2. Simplified Development
    - Focus on your application logic, not overhead:
        - With templates, thereâ€™s no need to write multiple custom contracts to parse events or aggregate signatures.
        - WAVS handles common AVS infrastructure, leaving AVS developers to focus on their core logic.
3. Multichain Ready
    - WAVS is built to operate across multiple blockchain environments and will be released with support for EVM networks.
    - WAVS will foster a multichain ecosystem for AVSs to interact and interoperate.
4. Intelligent Protocols & Composability
    - Enable asynchronous, verifiable execution flows across multiple on and off-chain components.
    - Compose multiple services to create dynamic intelligent protocols that surpass the limitations of traditional smart contracts.
