The following installations are required to run this example. Follow the steps below to set up your system.

<Callout title="System recommendations" type="info">

This tutorial is designed for Windows WSL, Linux, and macOS systems.

</Callout>

## Environment

Install [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) and the [Solidity extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=JuanBlanco.solidity) if you don't already have them.

## Rust

Run the following command to install [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

<Callout title="Fresh Install" type="info">

If you just installed Rust for the first time, you will need to run the following commands:

```bash
# Install required target and toolchain
rustup toolchain install stable
rustup target add wasm32-wasip2
```
</Callout>


<Callout title="Upgrade Rust" type="info">

If you already have a previous version of Rust installed, you will need to run the following commands to upgrade it to the latest stable version:

```bash
# Remove old targets if present
rustup target remove wasm32-wasi || true
rustup target remove wasm32-wasip1 || true

# Update and add required target
rustup update stable
rustup target add wasm32-wasip2
```
</Callout>


## Cargo Components

Install the following for building WebAssembly components. Visit the [Cargo Component documentation](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/cargo-component#installation) for more information.

{/* This section is also in [](./5-build.mdx). Remember to update there as well */}
```bash
cargo install cargo-binstall
cargo binstall cargo-component warg-cli wkg --locked --no-confirm --force

# Configure default registry
wkg config --default-registry wa.dev
```

## Foundry

[Foundry](https://book.getfoundry.sh/) is a solidity development suite. The Foundry toolchain contains Anvil (a local testnet node), Forge (build and test smart contracts), Cast (an RPC call CLI), and Chisel (a Solidity REPL).


1. Install Foundryup, the official Foundry installer.

```bash
curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash
```

2. Install Foundry

```bash
foundryup
```

<Callout title="Docker for MacOS" type="warn">

{/* This section is also in [](./5-build.mdx). Remember to update there as well */}

If you are using Docker Desktop, make sure it is open and running for this tutorial.

Before proceeding, make sure that the following setting is updated:

**Enable Host Networking**: Open Docker and navigate to -> Settings -> Resources -> Network. Make sure that 'Enable Host Networking' is turned on.

Alternatively, you can install the following:

```bash
brew install chipmk/tap/docker-mac-net-connect && sudo brew services start chipmk/tap/docker-mac-net-connect
```

If you are running on a Mac with an ARM chip, you will need to do the following:

- Set up Rosetta:

```bash
softwareupdate --install-rosetta`
```

- Enable Rosetta (Docker Desktop: Settings -> General -> enable "Use Rosetta for x86_64/amd64 emulation on Apple Silicon")
